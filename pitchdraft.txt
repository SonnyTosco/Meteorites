Meteorites Pitch Ideas

Problem we solve:
Finding a social way to stargaze

- skit intro
  - scrolling thru facebook feed for a cool event
    - get to the event and you can't see it
      - or you can, but it's not a social experience
      - that's where Stardate comes in. Stardate is a social community that allows
      you to connect with other stargazers. We curate events like lunar eclipses and meteor showers
      so you can enjoy them with old friends or new ones. Think of it as Eventbrite meets stargazing. Let's see how it works.

Pseudo
- take a given address
- interpolate the address into a geocode url
- parse through and get the lat/long
- take that lat/long data and create a marker for it
- save that into the database for that specific event
